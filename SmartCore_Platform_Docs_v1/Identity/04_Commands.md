Title: SmartCore Identity Platform - Commands Blueprint
Version: 1.1.0
Status: READY_FOR_GENERATION

Purpose:
Define Identity Platform Public Command contracts,
orchestration boundaries, and Domain Event outcomes.

Dependencies:
- 00_Overview.md
- 01_Domain_Model.md
- 02_Use_Cases.md
- 03_Aggregates.md
- 14_MVP.md

- ADR-0003_Organization_and_Membership_Lifecycle_Standardization.md

Change Log:
- Version 1.1.0 (2026-07-14): Corrected RegisterPerson's orchestrator
  references from `RegistrationDomainService` to
  `RegistrationApplicationService` throughout (§2.2, §3, §4.1, §5.1, §7),
  to synchronize with 01_Domain_Model.md v1.2.0 and 03_Aggregates.md
  v1.1.0, which reclassified this orchestrator as an Application Service
  per ADR-0002 Decision 7.1. Renamed §3 and §7 table columns from
  "Domain Service" to "Orchestrating Service" and added a Type column
  in §7 to make the single Application Service exception explicit. No
  Command behavior, contract, or MVP scope changed.
- Version 1.0.0:
  Initial Commands Blueprint creation.
-->

# 1. Overview

This document defines the Public Command contracts of the SmartCore
Identity Platform.

Commands represent intentional state-changing operations exposed by the
Identity Capability.

Each Command specification defines:

- Command intent
- Actor
- Preconditions
- Input requirements
- Validation rules
- Aggregate interaction boundaries
- Domain Service orchestration ownership
- Domain Event outcomes
- Failure conditions
- MVP constraints

Commands describe business intent only. Transport concerns,
serialization formats, API endpoints, and external communication
protocols are intentionally excluded and deferred to contract and API
documentation.

This document introduces no new:

- Aggregates
- Domain Events
- Business Rules
- Lifecycle States
- Capabilities

All Command definitions are derived from:

- Domain Model
- Aggregate Definitions
- Use Cases
- MVP Scope
- Identity Platform Event Ownership Model
- Approved Architectural Decisions

---

# 2. Command Design Principles

## 2.1 Intent-Based Operations

Commands represent business intent, not technical operations.

A Command answers:

> "What business action is requested?"

A Command does not define:

- HTTP methods
- Message schemas
- Database operations
- Infrastructure implementation

---

## 2.2 Aggregate Boundary Protection

Each Command SHALL operate within the consistency boundaries defined by
the Aggregate Model.

Commands SHALL NOT directly manipulate multiple Aggregates.

When a business operation requires coordination between multiple
Aggregates, orchestration SHALL be performed by the responsible Domain
Service, or, for the single approved exception described below, by an
Application Service.

Example:

`RegisterPerson` coordinates:

- Person creation
- Personal Organization creation
- Owner Membership creation

through `RegistrationApplicationService` (ADR-0002 Decision 7 exception;
see 01_Domain_Model.md §8). This is the only Command in MVP orchestrated
by an Application Service rather than a Domain Service; all other
Commands in this catalog are orchestrated by Domain Services as
described in §2.3.

---

## 2.3 Domain Service Orchestration

Command execution SHALL delegate business workflow coordination to the
appropriate Domain Service.

The Command handler SHALL NOT contain:

- Cross-Aggregate business workflows
- Ownership transaction logic
- Lifecycle orchestration rules

---

## 2.4 Event Ownership Compliance

Every Command SHALL produce only the Domain Events defined by the
Identity Platform Event Ownership Table.

Commands SHALL NOT:

- Introduce new Event types
- Rename existing Events
- Change Event ownership

Event taxonomy classification is outside the scope of this document.

---

## 2.5 MVP Boundary Protection

Commands SHALL respect MVP scope boundaries.

No Command SHALL introduce:

- Future lifecycle transitions
- Authorization capabilities
- RBAC management
- Enterprise identity providers
- Administrative workflows

outside the approved MVP scope.

---

# 3. Public Command Catalog

The Identity Platform MVP defines exactly six Public Commands.

| # | Command Name | Primary Aggregate | Orchestrating Service |
|---|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | RegisterPerson | Person | RegistrationApplicationService (Application Service — ADR-0002 Decision 7 exception) |
| 2 | AuthenticatePerson | Session | AuthenticationDomainService |
| 3 | UpdatePersonProfile | Person | PersonManagementDomainService |
| 4 | LogoutSession | Session | SessionManagementDomainService |
| 5 | RefreshSession | Session | SessionManagementDomainService |
| 6 | ChangePassword | Credential | CredentialManagementDomainService |

RegisterPerson is the only Command orchestrated by an Application
Service rather than a Domain Service (see §2.2, §7). No additional
Public Commands exist within MVP scope.

---

# 4. Command Specifications

# 4.1 RegisterPerson

## Command Name

`RegisterPerson`

## Purpose

Creates a new Person identity together with the initial ownership
boundary consisting of:

- Personal Organization
- Owner Membership

This Command establishes the canonical Identity ownership structure
defined by the Tenancy and Ownership Model.

---

## Actor

New User

---

## Preconditions

- No existing Person exists with the provided email
- Identity Platform is operational

---

## Input

Required:

- Email
- Password
- DisplayName

---

## Validation Rules

- Email SHALL be provided
- Email SHALL be valid and normalized
- Email SHALL be unique across all Persons
- Password SHALL satisfy credential requirements
- DisplayName SHALL satisfy format and length constraints

---

## Aggregate Interaction

### Core Ownership Transaction

The following Aggregates participate in the atomic ownership creation
transaction:

| Aggregate | Operation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Person | Create |
| Organization | Create |
| Membership | Create |

The Core Ownership Transaction SHALL commit atomically.

Partial ownership state is prohibited.

---

### Post-Commit Operations

After successful Core Ownership Transaction commit:

| Aggregate | Operation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Credential | Create |
| Session | Create |

Failure of Post-Commit Operations SHALL NOT invalidate already committed
ownership consistency.

Recovery behavior is implementation-specific.

---

## Orchestrating Service

`RegistrationApplicationService`

This is an Application Service, not a Domain Service — the single
approved exception authorized by ADR-0002 Decision 7 (Command Model
Coordination Exception for Identity Registration). See
01_Domain_Model.md §8.

---

---

# 4.5 RefreshSession

## Command Name

`RefreshSession`

---

## Purpose

Refreshes an existing authenticated Session token context without

# 5. Internal Domain Operations

The following operations are internal orchestration steps performed by
Domain Services, or, for Registration (§5.1), by the
RegistrationApplicationService (ADR-0002 Decision 7 exception).

They SHALL NOT be exposed as independent Public Commands.

---

# 5.1 Registration Internal Operations

Performed by:

`RegistrationApplicationService` (Application Service — ADR-0002
Decision 7 exception; see 01_Domain_Model.md §8)

as part of:

`RegisterPerson`

---

## Create Person

Purpose:

Creates the Person Aggregate within the Core Ownership Transaction.

---

## Create Personal Organization

Purpose:

Creates the initial Personal Organization owned by the Person.

---

## Create Membership

Purpose:

Creates the Owner Membership connecting Person and Personal
Organization.

---

## Commit Core Ownership Transaction

Rules:

- Person
- Organization
- Membership

commit atomically.

Partial ownership state is prohibited.

---

## Post-Commit Credential Creation

Purpose:

Creates initial Credential after successful ownership commit.

- Expiration handling

These operations are only available through Public Commands defined in
this Blueprint.

They SHALL NOT become independent Public Commands.

---
# 6. Command → Aggregate Mapping

The following table defines the relationship between Public Commands and
Aggregate interactions.

| Command | Person | Organization | Membership | Credential | Session |
|---------|--------|--------------|------------|------------|---------|
| RegisterPerson | Create | Create | Create | Create (Post-Commit) | Create (Post-Commit) |
| AuthenticatePerson | Read / Validate | - | - | Validate | Create |
| UpdatePersonProfile | Update | - | - | - | Read / Validate |
| LogoutSession | - | - | - | - | Update |
| RefreshSession | - | - | - | - | Read / Validate / Update |
| ChangePassword | Read | - | - | Create / Update | Read / Validate |

---

# 7. Command → Orchestrating Service Mapping

Each Public Command SHALL be orchestrated by exactly one owning Domain
Service, except RegisterPerson, which is orchestrated by an Application
Service under the approved ADR-0002 Decision 7 exception.

| Command | Orchestrating Service | Type |
|---------|------------------------|------|
| RegisterPerson | RegistrationApplicationService | Application Service (ADR-0002 Decision 7 exception) |
| AuthenticatePerson | AuthenticationDomainService | Domain Service |
| UpdatePersonProfile | PersonManagementDomainService | Domain Service |
| LogoutSession | SessionManagementDomainService | Domain Service |
| RefreshSession | SessionManagementDomainService | Domain Service |
| ChangePassword | CredentialManagementDomainService | Domain Service |

---

# 8. Command → Event Mapping

This mapping follows the Identity Platform Event Ownership Table.

No new Domain Events are introduced by this Blueprint.

| Command | Events Produced |
|---------|-----------------|
| RegisterPerson | PersonRegistered, OrganizationCreated, MembershipCreated |
| AuthenticatePerson | LoginSucceeded, LoginFailed, SessionCreated |
| UpdatePersonProfile | PersonUpdated |
| LogoutSession | LogoutCompleted |
| RefreshSession | None |
| ChangePassword | PasswordChanged |

---

# 9. Command Lifecycle Rules

## 9.1 Aggregate Ownership Boundary

Each Command SHALL respect Aggregate consistency boundaries.

A Command SHALL NOT directly mutate multiple Aggregates.

When multiple Aggregates participate in one business operation:

- Domain Service owns orchestration
- Aggregate rules remain isolated
- Transaction boundaries follow approved architecture decisions

---

## 9.2 Registration Ownership Transaction Boundary

`RegisterPerson` contains a special Core Ownership Transaction.

The transaction includes:

- Person creation
- Personal Organization creation
- Owner Membership creation

The following rule applies:

> Partial ownership state SHALL never exist.

If any Core Ownership operation fails:

- Entire transaction is rolled back
- No incomplete ownership structure remains

---

## 9.3 Post-Commit Operation Boundary

Operations after Core Ownership Transaction commit SHALL NOT invalidate
ownership consistency.

Post-Commit operations include:

- Credential creation
- Initial Session creation

Failure handling of Post-Commit operations is implementation-specific.

---

## 9.4 Identity and Authorization Separation

Identity Commands SHALL NOT evaluate permissions.

Identity Platform responsibilities:

- Establish identity
- Manage credentials
- Manage sessions
- Maintain membership context

Authorization decisions remain outside MVP scope.

---

# 10. Command Invariants

The following invariants SHALL remain true throughout the MVP lifecycle.

---

## Invariant-001: Person Identity Stability

PersonId is immutable.

A Person identity cannot be replaced through profile update operations.

---

## Invariant-002: Ownership Creation Boundary

During MVP:

Only `RegisterPerson` can create:

- Personal Organization
- Owner Membership

---

## Invariant-003: Authentication Isolation

Authentication attempts SHALL NOT modify:

- Person state
- Credential state

unless the Command explicitly represents a Credential lifecycle change.

---

## Invariant-004: Session Refresh Isolation

`RefreshSession` SHALL NOT create:

- Person
- Organization
- Membership
- Credential

---

## Invariant-005: Credential Active State

A Person SHALL have at most one Active Credential.

Credential replacement SHALL preserve this invariant.

---

## Invariant-006: Membership Role Limitation

Within MVP:

- Owner is the only Membership Role
- Role management is outside Command scope

---

# 11. MVP Command Boundary

This Blueprint confirms the following MVP limitations.

---

## Included Commands

The Identity Platform MVP exposes exactly:

1. RegisterPerson
2. AuthenticatePerson
3. UpdatePersonProfile
4. LogoutSession
5. RefreshSession
6. ChangePassword

---

## Excluded Capabilities

The following capabilities are intentionally excluded:

- Authorization evaluation
- Permission management
- RBAC management
- Delegation
- Enterprise SSO
- OAuth providers
- MFA
- Administrative lifecycle management

---

# 12. Out of Scope Commands

The following Commands are future scope and SHALL NOT be implemented
within this Blueprint version.

---

## Organization Lifecycle

- SuspendOrganization
- ResumeOrganization
- ArchiveOrganization

---

## Membership Lifecycle

- RevokeMembership
- ChangeMembershipRole

---

## Person Lifecycle

- SuspendPerson
- ArchivePerson
- RestoreArchivedPerson

---

## Authorization Commands

- AssignRole
- RemoveRole
- CreatePermission
- GrantPermission
- RevokePermission

---

## Alternative Credential Commands

- RegisterOAuthCredential
- ConfigureEnterpriseSSO
- ManageExternalIdentityProvider

---

# 13. Open Architectural Notes

The following topics are intentionally not resolved by this Blueprint.

They represent possible future ADR candidates and SHALL NOT alter MVP
Command contracts.

---

## 13.1 Event Classification

Future consideration:

- Domain Event classification
- Security Event classification
- Audit Event classification

Current Blueprint follows the existing Identity Platform Event
Ownership model.

---

## 13.2 Session Security Policies

Future consideration:

- Password change session invalidation policy
- Suspicious session detection
- Advanced session revocation workflows

Current MVP behavior:

Password changes do not affect active Sessions.

---

## 13.3 Email Verification Lifecycle

Future consideration:

- Email ownership verification
- Email change confirmation workflow
- Identity identifier migration rules

Current MVP behavior:

Email update remains part of Person profile update.

---

## 13.4 Session Lifecycle Refinement

Future consideration:

- Session state machine simplification
- Additional security lifecycle states

Current Blueprint follows the existing Session lifecycle definition.

---

Renamed the "Domain Service" columns in §3 and §7 to "Orchestrating
Service" and made the Application Service exception explicit.

No Command contract, behavior, Aggregate mapping, Event mapping, or MVP
scope changed.

---

## Version 1.0.0
