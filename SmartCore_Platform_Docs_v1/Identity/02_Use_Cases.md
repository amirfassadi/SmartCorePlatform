```
# 1. Overview

This document defines all externally-visible use cases for the Identity
Platform Blueprint.

Use cases describe user goals and the main flow of interactions required
to achieve those goals within the Identity Platform.

Use cases do NOT define:

-   Database design or persistence strategy
-   API contracts or technology choices
-   Authorization decisions or permission evaluation
-   New business capabilities beyond Identity Platform scope
-   New aggregates or lifecycle states
-   New events not defined by Identity Foundation (059)

All use cases align with:

-   Domain Model (01_Domain_Model.md)
-   Aggregate Definitions (03_Aggregates.md)
-   MVP Scope (14_MVP.md)
-   Event Ownership (059_SmartCore_Identity_Platform.md §9)
-   Registration Architecture (059_SmartCore_Identity_Platform.md §6)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Use Case Structure

Each use case includes:

-   **UC Code**: Unique identifier (UC-NNN)
-   **Title**: Use case name
-   **Actor**: Primary actor initiating the use case
-   **Goal**: Desired outcome from actor perspective
-   **Preconditions**: State required before use case begins
-   **Main Flow**: Primary sequence of steps to achieve goal
-   **Alternative Flows**: Optional variations of main flow
-   **Failure Conditions**: Scenarios where use case cannot complete
-   **Postconditions**: State after successful completion
-   **Domain References**: Aggregates, Domain Services, Events involved

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Use Cases

## UC-001: Register Person

**Actor**: New User

**Goal**: Create a new Person identity and establish the ownership
boundary.

**Preconditions**:

-   Registration request received with user identity information
    (typically email, password, display name)
-   No Person currently exists with the provided identity (email)
-   System is operational

**Main Flow**:

1.  Receive registration request
2.  Execute Registration Core Transaction:
    -   Create Person (Aggregate: Person)
    -   Create Personal Organization (Aggregate: Organization)
    -   Create Owner Membership (Aggregate: Membership)
    -   Commit transaction atomically
3.  Upon successful commit, execute Post-Commit Identity Operations:
    -   Create Credential for the Person (Aggregate: Credential)
    -   Create Initial Session through Authentication lifecycle
        (Aggregate: Session)
    -   Publish Identity Events: PersonRegistered, OrganizationCreated, MembershipCreated

Note: PersonRegistered indicates completion of the registration
experience including initial authentication capability. OrganizationCreated
and MembershipCreated are independent events published by RegistrationApplicationService.
Ownership consistency is already guaranteed by the Core Ownership Transaction.
Failure of post-commit operations SHALL NOT invalidate Person,
Organization, or Membership.
4. Return registration success to user

**Alternative Flows**:

-   Core Transaction may be retried if transient failures occur
-   Post-commit operation failures do not invalidate registration
    success
-   Post-commit recovery is implementation-specific

**Failure Conditions**:

-   Person with same email already exists: Return conflict error;
    rollback transaction
-   Core Transaction fails: Rollback all ownership changes; return
    failure to user
-   Email format invalid: Return validation error before transaction
-   Personal Organization creation fails: Rollback transaction; return
    failure
-   Membership creation fails: Rollback transaction; return failure

**Postconditions**:

-   Person exists with status = Active
-   Personal Organization exists with status = Active, category =
    Personal
-   Owner Membership exists linking Person to Organization, status =
    Active
-   Credential exists for Person, status = Active
-   Initial Session exists, status = Authenticated
-   PersonRegistered, OrganizationCreated, MembershipCreated Events published
-   Email is unique across all Persons

**Domain References**:

-   Aggregates: Person, Organization, Membership, Credential, Session
-   Application Services: RegistrationApplicationService (ADR-0002 Decision 7 exception; see 01_Domain_Model.md §8)
-   Events: PersonRegistered, OrganizationCreated, MembershipCreated
-   Lifecycle: Person (Registered→Active), Organization
    (Created→Active), Membership (Created→Active)
-   Architecture: Core Ownership Transaction + Post-Commit Operations
    (059 §6)

**Constraints**:

-   Registration establishes canonical ownership path (057 §3)
-   Personal Organization is the only Organization type created in MVP
-   Owner is the only Membership Role created in MVP
-   No Credential History tracking in MVP
-   Sessions created as independent Aggregate (Session is not owned by
    Person in consistency boundary)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## UC-002: Create Credential

**Actor**: Registration Flow / Person (during initial setup or
credential change)

**Goal**: Create an authentication credential for a Person.

**Preconditions**:

-   Person exists with status = Active (UC-001 creates initial
    credential)
-   No active Credential currently exists for the Person (or existing
    credential is being replaced)
-   System is operational

**Main Flow**:

1.  Receive credential creation request (typically password)
2.  Validate credential format and strength
3.  Create Credential Aggregate for Person:
    -   Generate PasswordHash
    -   Set status = Active
    -   Record CreatedAt timestamp
4.  Persist Credential
5.  Return credential creation success

**Alternative Flows**:

-   Credential replacement (see UC-006 Change Credential for lifecycle)

**Failure Conditions**:

-   Person does not exist: Return not-found error
-   Credential format invalid or too weak: Return validation error

    for replacement)

**Postconditions**:

-   Credential exists for Person, status = Active
-   PasswordHash securely stores password information
-   Credential can be used for authentication (UC-003)
-   One active Credential per Person exists in MVP

**Domain References**:

-   Aggregates: Credential, Person
-   Domain Services: CredentialManagementDomainService
-   Events: (Published during registration via UC-001; not published
    independently in MVP)
-   Lifecycle: Credential (Created→Active)

**Constraints**:

-   No Credential History in MVP (Version 1.x)
-   No multiple active Credentials per Person in MVP
-   Credential is independent Aggregate with own consistency boundary

        failure
6.  Return authentication outcome

**Alternative Flows**:

-   Multi-attempt authentication may be rate-limited
    (implementation-specific)
-   Session creation may occur in same operation or follow separately
    (see UC-004)

**Failure Conditions**:

**Domain References**:

-   Aggregates: Person, Credential, Session
-   Domain Services: AuthenticationDomainService
-   Events: LoginSucceeded, LoginFailed, SessionCreated
-   Lifecycle: No state changes to Person or Credential

**Constraints**:

    -   DisplayName length and format valid
4.  Update Person attributes:
    -   Email (if provided and valid)
    -   DisplayName (if provided and valid)
    -   Set UpdatedAt timestamp
5.  Persist Person changes
6.  Publish PersonUpdated Event

    -   Record CreatedAt timestamp
6.  Persist new Credential
7.  Mark old Credential status = Replaced (or archive/delete per
    implementation)
8.  Publish PasswordChanged Event
9.  Return credential change success

**Alternative Flows**:

-   Initial Credential creation during registration (UC-001) does not

-   Refresh requires valid RefreshTokenId (security)
-   RefreshTokenId must be revocable for security

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Out of Scope

The following are NOT MVP use cases and remain future scope:

**Organization Lifecycle Operations**:

-   UC-F01: Suspend Organization (future)
-   UC-F02: Resume Organization (future)
-   UC-F03: Archive Organization (future)
-   UC-F04: Create Additional Organizations (future)

**Membership Operations**:

-   UC-F05: Revoke Membership (future)
-   UC-F06: Change Membership Role (future)
-   UC-F07: Create Multiple Memberships (future)



**Credential Operations**:

-   UC-F09: Credential History (future)
-   UC-F10: Multiple Active Credentials per Person (future)
-   UC-F11: Alternative Credential Types (OAuth, SSO, etc.) (future)

**Person Operations**:

-   UC-F12: Suspend Person (future)
-   UC-F13: Archive Person (future)
-   UC-F14: Restore Archived Person (future)

**Identity Extensions**:

-   UC-F15: Device Identity (future)
-   UC-F16: Service Identity (future)
-   UC-F17: AI Agent Identity (future)

**Authorization Operations**:

-   UC-F18: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Authorization Platform,
    not Identity)
-   UC-F19: Permission Assignment (Authorization Platform, not Identity)
-   UC-F20: Delegated Administration (future)

**Rationale**:

-   Lifecycle operations require Commands and APIs not part of MVP
-   Lifecycle states exist in Domain Model for architectural
    completeness and future evolution
-   Alternative credential types require future authentication mechanism
    extension
-   Authorization decisions belong to future Authorization Platform
-   Additional identity types belong to future extensibility

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Use Case Dependencies

**Registration Chain**:

UC-001 → UC-002 (during post-commit) → UC-004 (during post-commit)

**Authentication Chain**:

UC-003 → UC-004 (upon success)

**Session End Chain**:

UC-007 (triggered by user logout or system timer)

**Profile Management Chain**:

UC-005 (user-initiated)

**Credential Management Chain**:

UC-006 (user-initiated after authentication)

**Membership Creation Chain**:

UC-008 (part of UC-001)

**Refresh Session Chain**:

UC-003 Authenticate Person
↓
UC-004 Create Session
↓
UC-009 Refresh Session

Note: UC-009 operates on existing Session without creating new Person, Credential, or Membership. Refresh is Session token maintenance only.

# 8. MVP Constraints Verification

This section verifies that all use cases respect MVP scope constraints
from 14_MVP.md.

**Person Operations**:

-   ✅ UC-001 creates Person in Active state
-   ✅ UC-005 updates Person profile without state transition
-   ✅ No UC transitions Person to Suspended, Archived, or other states

**Organization Operations**:

-   ✅ UC-001 creates Organization in Active state as Personal
    Organization
-   ✅ No UC creates additional Organizations
-   ✅ No UC transitions Organization to Suspended, Archived, or other
    states

**Membership Operations**:

-   ✅ UC-001 creates Membership with Owner role
-   ✅ UC-008 creates Membership with Owner role only
-   ✅ No UC supports additional roles (Admin, Member, Guest, Operator)
-   ✅ No UC revokes Membership

**Session Operations**:

-   ✅ UC-003 initiates authentication
-   ✅ UC-004 creates Session and transitions through lifecycle
-   ✅ UC-007 closes or expires Session
-   ✅ Session lifecycle operations required by MVP are documented,
    including session creation, authentication state establishment,
    expiration, and closure. Additional lifecycle transitions are
    outside current MVP scope.

**Credential Operations**:

-   ✅ UC-002 creates initial Credential (password)
-   ✅ UC-006 replaces Credential with new password
-   ✅ No UC implements Credential History
-   ✅ No UC creates multiple active Credentials per Person

**Event Publishing**:

-   ✅ All use cases publish only events defined in 059 Event Ownership
    Table
-   ✅ No use case introduces new event types
-   ✅ Events map correctly to Domain Services in 01_Domain_Model.md

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Validation Against Reference Standards

This use case specification aligns with:

**064 - Blueprint Standard §8.3 Use Cases**:

-   ✅ Each use case includes Goal, Actors, Preconditions, Main Flow,
    Alternative Flows, Failure Conditions, Postconditions
-   ✅ Use cases describe behavior, not implementation
-   ✅ Use cases map to Domain Model (01_Domain_Model.md)

**065 - Blueprint Validator Specification**:

-   ✅ Use cases reference only Domain Model entities
-   ✅ No new Aggregates introduced
-   ✅ No new Events beyond Event Ownership Table
-   ✅ No lifecycle contradictions
-   ✅ MVP constraints preserved

**066 - AI Code Generation Specification**:

-   ✅ Use cases provide sufficient detail for deterministic AI-assisted
    implementation
-   ✅ Preconditions and postconditions explicitly state state
    requirements
-   ✅ Main flow provides step-by-step orchestration guidance
-   ✅ Domain Service mapping clear for each use case
-   ✅ Event publication requirements explicit

# 10. Change Log

## Version 1.1.0 (2026-07-09)

**Identity Use Cases Corrections and Alignment**:

- Added UC-009 Refresh Session aligned with MVP Session Management scope
- Corrected Identity event publication mapping in UC-001 to include all three independent events: PersonRegistered, OrganizationCreated, MembershipCreated
- Clarified MembershipCreated as independent event in UC-008
- Corrected Aggregate Participation Matrix to reflect actual Domain References for Person and Session interactions in all use cases
- Corrected lifecycle validation wording to reflect actual documented operations
- Added UC-009 Refresh Session to Use Case Dependencies chain
- Updated Event Publication Map to show all events for UC-001 and UC-008
- No architecture changes introduced
- No new aggregates or events introduced
- No MVP scope expansion

## Version 1.0.0 (2026-07-09)

**Initial Use Case Specification**:

-   Created 8 MVP use cases: UC-001 through UC-008
-   Each use case includes Goal, Actors, Preconditions, Main Flow,
    Alternative Flows, Failure Conditions, Postconditions
-   Aligned with 01_Domain_Model.md (5 Aggregates, 5 Domain Services)
-   Aligned with 14_MVP.md (no Suspend/Archive/Revoke operations)
-   Aligned with 059_SmartCore_Identity_Platform.md (Event Ownership,
    Registration Architecture)
-   Explicit Out of Scope section documenting 20 future use cases
-   Aggregate Participation Matrix showing which use cases affect which
    aggregates
-   Event Publication Map showing Domain Service associations
-   MVP Constraints Verification section validating scope adherence
-   Validation against 064, 065, 066 standards

**Dependencies**:

-   00_Overview.md (v1.1.0)
-   01_Domain_Model.md (v1.1.0)
-   03_Aggregates.md (v1.0.0)
-   14_MVP.md (v1.0.0)
-   059_SmartCore_Identity_Platform.md (v1.1)
