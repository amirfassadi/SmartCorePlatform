Title: SmartCore Identity Platform Blueprint - Domain Model
Version: 1.2.1
Status: DRAFT
Purpose: Define the domain model, aggregates, entities, and value objects for the Identity Platform Blueprint
Dependencies: 019_SmartCore_Identity_and_Session_Continuity_Model, 041_SmartCore_Identity_Model, 064_SmartCore_Blueprint_Standard, ADR-0002_Identity_Foundation_Clarifications
Change Log:
  - Version 1.2.1 (2026-09-24): Corrected the header version to
    follow the existing v1.2.0 change log and marked the document
    Draft pending ADR-0002 Decisions 8–9, PRs #1–#3, dependent
    Blueprint alignment, and structural validation. Existing legacy
    field, cardinality, and registration-flow contracts are not
    approved for generation by this status update.
  - Version 1.2.0 (2026-07-12): Reclassified RegistrationDomainService as RegistrationApplicationService per ADR-0002 Decision 7.1; introduced dedicated Application Services section separate from Domain Services per 064 §14.2; updated Event Producer Mapping and cross-aggregate coordination note accordingly
  - Version 1.1.0 (2026-07-08): Added metadata completion, relationships section, missing domain services, session lifecycle correction, SessionToken resolution (added AccessTokenId), event audit requirements
  - Version 1.0.0 (2026-06-01): Initial domain model definition

# 1. Domain Model Overview

**Generation status**: Draft. The current EmailAddress Required rule,
Person-to-Active-Credential cardinality, and registration application
flow below predate proposed ADR-0002 Decisions 8–9. They SHALL NOT be
used as generation-ready statements for mobile-only or
PendingCredential registration. The next domain revision must define
verified mobile/email contact, optional Email, the durable workflow
boundary outside the five Aggregates, authentication gating, and
Ready-time PersonRegistered timing. Acceptance and structural
validation remain pending.

The Identity Domain consists of five Aggregates:

- Person
- Organization
- Membership
- Credential
- Session

All state changes SHALL occur through Aggregate Roots.

Cross-Aggregate coordination SHALL occur through Domain Services.

**Proposed exception**: The initial creation of Person, Personal Organization, and Owner Membership during registration is coordinated by an Application Service (RegistrationApplicationService), not a Domain Service. This narrowly-scoped exception is proposed in ADR-0002 Decision 7 (Command Model Coordination Exception for Identity Registration) and applies only to the RegisterPerson operation upon acceptance. See Section 8 (Application Services).

# 2. Entities

## Person

Represents a human identity.

Attributes:

- PersonId
- Email
- DisplayName
- Status
- CreatedAt
- UpdatedAt

Identity is immutable.

Email may change.

DisplayName may change.

---

## Organization

Represents ownership boundary.

Attributes:

- OrganizationId
- Name
- Category
- Status
- CreatedAt

Category MVP:

- Personal

Future categories belong to future scope.

---

## Membership

Represents participation.

Attributes:

- MembershipId
- PersonId
- OrganizationId
- Role
- Status
- CreatedAt

MVP Role:

- Owner

---

## Credential

Represents authentication material.

Attributes:

- CredentialId
- PersonId
- PasswordHash
- PasswordVersion
- CreatedAt

Credential never stores plain text passwords.

---

## Session

Represents authenticated execution context.

Attributes:

- SessionId
- PersonId
- AccessTokenId
- RefreshTokenId
- DeviceInfo
- IpAddress
- ExpiresAt
- Status
- CreatedAt

---

# Relationships

Person (1) → (1..*) Membership
Organization (1) → (1..*) Membership
Membership (1) → (1) Person
Membership (1) → (1) Organization
Person (1) → (0..*) Session
Person (1) → (1) Active Credential

Note: Do NOT introduce Credential History in MVP. Credential History belongs to future extensibility.

---

# 3. Value Objects

## EmailAddress

Represents normalized email.

Rules:

- Required
- Valid format
- Case-insensitive comparison

---

## PasswordHash

Represents credential hash.

Rules:

- Immutable
- Generated using approved hashing algorithm

---

## AccessTokenId

Represents access token identity.

Token content is implementation-specific.

Note: This Value Object replaces the former SessionToken to maintain consistency with Session attributes.

---

## RefreshToken

Represents session continuation token.

Must be revocable.

---

# 4. Aggregate Definitions

Aggregate Roots:

- Person
- Organization
- Membership
- Credential
- Session

Each Aggregate owns its internal consistency.

Cross Aggregate consistency belongs to Domain Services.

---

# 5. Aggregate Lifecycles

## Person Lifecycle

Registered
↓
Active
↓
Suspended
↓
Archived

---

## Organization Lifecycle

Created
↓
Active
↓
Suspended
↓
Archived

Lifecycle diagrams represent MVP-visible lifecycle flow.

Full lifecycle transition rules, including reversible transitions such as Suspended → Active, are defined in ADR-0003.

No lifecycle transition commands are part of MVP.

---

## Membership Lifecycle

Created
↓
Active
↓
Revoked

---

## Credential Lifecycle

Created
↓
Active
↓
Replaced
↓
Revoked

---

## Session Lifecycle

Created
↓
Authenticated
↓
Active
↓
Suspended (optional)
↓
Expired
↓
Closed

Note: Suspended state is optional and aligns with Document 019 §6.

# 6. Domain Invariants

## Person Invariants

- PersonId is immutable
- Person MUST belong to at least one Organization
- Person MUST own at least one Membership after registration
- Identity survives Session expiration

---

## Organization Invariants

- OrganizationId is immutable
- Organization owns resources
- Organization is tenancy boundary
- Organization MUST have at least one Membership

---

## Membership Invariants

- Membership MUST reference one Person
- Membership MUST reference one Organization
- Membership is the only participation path

---

## Credential Invariants

- Password SHALL NOT be stored in plain text
- Credential MUST belong to one Person

---

## Session Invariants

- Session MUST reference one Person
- Session expiration SHALL NOT remove Identity
- Session MAY be revoked

---

# 7. Domain Services

Domain Services in this section describe intrinsic domain rules confined to coordinating behavior across Aggregates that already share a bounded context. Per 064 §14.2, orchestration of initial multi-Aggregate creation (registration) is an Application Service concern and is documented separately in Section 8.

## AuthenticationDomainService

Responsibilities:

- Validate Credential
- Resolve Person
- Create Session

Produces:

- LoginSucceeded
- LoginFailed
- SessionCreated

---

## SessionManagementDomainService

Responsibilities:

- Refresh Session
- Revoke Session
- Expire Session

Produces:

- SessionExpired
- LogoutCompleted

---

## PersonManagementDomainService

Responsibilities:

- Update Person Profile

Produces:

- PersonUpdated

---

## CredentialManagementDomainService

Responsibilities:

- Change Password
- Replace Credential

Produces:

- PasswordChanged

Note: Do NOT introduce `OrganizationManagementDomainService` or `MembershipManagementDomainService` into MVP. Lifecycle transition commands for Suspended / Archived / Revoked are future scope.

---

# 8. Application Services

Application Services perform orchestration across multiple Aggregate operations. They are not part of the Domain Model's business-rule layer and SHALL NOT be modeled as Domain Services (064 §14.2).

## RegistrationApplicationService

Coordinates atomic registration across the core ownership transaction and post-commit operations. This is the proposed exception to standard cross-aggregate coordination under ADR-0002 Decision 7, limited to RegisterPerson and pending acceptance.

### Core Transaction Phase

Responsibilities (atomic, single transaction):

- Create Person
- Create Organization (Personal Organization)
- Create Membership (Owner role)

Transaction Commit: All three ownership entities must be successfully persisted.

### Post-Commit Phase

Responsibilities (after transaction commit, non-blocking):

- Request Credential creation through CredentialManagementDomainService
- Request Initial Session creation through Authentication lifecycle
- Publish Registration Events

Produces:

- PersonRegistered
- OrganizationCreated
- MembershipCreated

**Note**: SessionCreated is produced by AuthenticationDomainService after successful Initial Session creation.
RegistrationApplicationService coordinates the registration flow but does
not own Session lifecycle events. Credential creation is likewise delegated to CredentialManagementDomainService rather than performed directly, keeping Credential business rules inside the Domain layer.

**Transaction Semantics**: Core transaction failure rolls back all ownership changes. Post-commit operation failures do not invalidate ownership relationships.

**Scope Limitation**: This exception applies only to RegisterPerson. It SHALL NOT be treated as precedent for other multi-Aggregate orchestration (ADR-0002 §"Scope Limitation").

---

# Event Producer Mapping

The following Domain Services and Application Services produce the events declared in 059_SmartCore_Identity_Platform.md Event Ownership Table.

This mapping ensures event ownership traceability and MVP scope validation.

## RegistrationApplicationService Produces

- PersonRegistered
- OrganizationCreated
- MembershipCreated

## AuthenticationDomainService Produces

- LoginSucceeded
- LoginFailed
- SessionCreated

## SessionManagementDomainService Produces

- SessionExpired
- LogoutCompleted

## PersonManagementDomainService Produces

- PersonUpdated

## CredentialManagementDomainService Produces

- PasswordChanged

**Validation Note**: All 10 events in 059 Event Ownership Table are accounted for by MVP Domain Services and the RegistrationApplicationService. No orphaned or unclassified events exist.

---
